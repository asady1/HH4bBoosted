This repository contains the 76X versions of code to produce the trees needed to set the limits for HH->bbbb. The .sh files run over the Heppy Ntuples using generalTreeAnalyzer_76X.py and drawing the name of the files from the .txt files in the TxtFiles/ directory. The options for running, specified in the .sh file, include trigger (apply the trigger cut), jets (apply the jet pt and eta cuts), deta (apply the delta eta cut), and isMC (to distinguish tree information meant to be only in the MC trees).# HH4bBoosted
